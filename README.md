# Evernode SDK
Evernode SDK consists of libraries and tools required to develop and deploy Hot Pocket smart contracts on Evernode. This repo is used to provide early access to libraries and tools that are work-in-progress and get feedback.

## Hot Pocket developer kit
Evernode uses Hot Pocket as its smart contract engine. Hot Pocket smart contracts can be developed using any POSIX-compliant language/framework. To make it easy to develop and test Hot Pocket smart contracts on your local PC, you can use [Hot Pocket developer kit](hpdevkit).
