# Using the contract context

When HotPocket invokes your smart contract application, it passes some contextual data about the current execution of the smart contract. It passes this information as a JSON payload via the standard input (STDIN) of your application. The HotPocket nodejs contract library automatically handles this and exposes this to your application via the `ctx` parameter.

```javascript
const HotPocket = require("hotpocket-nodejs-contract");

const mycontract = async (ctx) => {
  // ctx parameter provides the contextual information.
  console.log(ctx.contractId);
};

const hpc = new HotPocket.Contract();
hpc.init(mycontract);
```

### contractId

This is the GUID string of the contract which is specified at the time of deploying the contract. This is used as a validation mechanism by all the nodes of a cluster and the users to ensure they are talking with instances of the correct contract.

Example with javascript client using contract id validation:

```javascript
const client = await HotPocket.createClient(
  ["wss://localhost:8081"],
  userKeyPair,
  {
    contractId: "3c349abe-4d70-4f50-9fa6-018f1f2530ab",
  }
);
```

This client will drop the connection if the contract id presented by the HotPocket instance its connecting to does not match.

### publicKey and privateKey

ed22519 public key of the node in hexadecimal format prefixed with 'ed'. HotPocket uses this key pair to sign its messages to other nodes and users. Any party can get the help of this to verify that it is indeed communicating with the a trusted node.

Example with javascript client using public key validation:

```javascript
const client = await HotPocket.createClient(
  ["wss://localhost:8081"],
  userKeyPair,
  {
    trustedServerKeys: [
      "ed5597c207bbd251997b7133d5d83a2c6ab9600810edf0bdb43f4004852b8c9e17",
    ],
  }
);
```

### readonly

A boolean indicating whether the contract is being invoked due to a consensus execution or a [read request](tutorial-readreq.md). In readonly mode, the filesystem is readonly and represents the last consensus state.

### timestamp

Consensus timestamp of the last closed ledger in UNIX epoch milliseconds. If you need to use a deterministic timestamp in your contract that is compatible with consensus, you should use this. Using the system time for consensus data (eg. user outputs or state) will cause consensus to fail.

### users

Contains the list of [users](tutorial-basics.md#access-user-information) who were connected to the cluster during the last consensus round. Via this, you can retrieave any inputs sent by users and also generate user outputs.

### unl

Contains information about the nodes that participate in consensus. Via this you can broadcast and receive [NPL messages](tutorial-npl.md) with contract instances of other UNL nodes in a real-time manner.

### lclSeqNo and lclHash

This is the last closed ledger sequence number and the hexadecimal hash. During consensus the ledger data is salted with an agreed-upon random value. Therefore, you could use the lcl hash as a deterministic random seed for your contract.
